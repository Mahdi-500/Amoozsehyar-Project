# How to change the database to PostgreSQL
after installing PostgreSQL do the steps below:

1 - go to settings.py

2 - find the database part

3 - replace the fields below with your database information

    'NAME': 'your database name',
    'USER': 'your username',
    'PASSWORD': 'username password',
    'PORT': 'your port number',
    
# notes
after running the server in the URL part add \CarBlog at the end

**To use the search featur you have to have Postgresql installed**

the database is PostgreSQL now (it was the default one before)
